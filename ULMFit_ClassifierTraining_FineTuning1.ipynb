              "xxbos \" i 've tried a few antidepressants over the years ( citalopram , fluoxetine , amitriptyline ) , but none of those helped with my depression , insomnia & & anxiety . xxmaj my doctor suggested and changed me onto 45 mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life . xxmaj thankfully i have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain , i 've actually lost alot of weight . i still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me . \",xxbos \" xxmaj my son has xxmaj crohn 's disease and has done very well on the xxmaj asacol . xxmaj he has no complaints and shows no side effects . xxmaj he has taken as many as nine tablets per day at one time . i 've been very happy with the results , reducing his bouts of diarrhea drastically . \",xxbos \" xxmaj quick reduction of symptoms \",xxbos \" xxmaj contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol , smoking , and opioid cessation . xxmaj people lose weight on it because it also helps control over - eating . i have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar / carb addiction , which is just as powerful as any drug . i have been taking it for five days , and the good news is , it seems to go to work immediately . i feel hungry before i want food now . i really do n't care to eat ; it 's just to fill my stomach . xxmaj since i have only been on it a few days , i do n't know if i 've lost weight ( i do n't have a scale ) , but my clothes do feel a little looser , so maybe a pound or two . i 'm hoping that after a few months on this medication , i will develop healthier habits that i can continue without the aid of xxmaj contrave . \",xxbos \" i have been on this birth control for one cycle . xxmaj after reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls i was a bit apprehensive to start . i m giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as i have not been on it long enough for a 10 . xxmaj so far i love this birth control ! xxmaj my side effects have been so minimal its like i m not even on birth control ! i have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that i ve been feeling great ! i got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and i had no idea it was coming because i had zero pms ! xxmaj my period was very light and i barely had any cramping ! i had unprotected sex the first month and obviously did n't get pregnant so i 'm very pleased ! xxmaj highly recommend \"\n",
